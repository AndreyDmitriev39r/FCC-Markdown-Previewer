## Build a Markdown Previewer

Objective - to build an app similar to this:

[Example on codepen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO)

## Requirements

### Technologies: possible options

**vanilla**


* HTML

* JavaScript

* CSS

**CSS preprocessors**

* Bootstrap

* SASS

**JS frameworks**

* React

* Redux

* jQuery

### User stories

* #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

* #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

* #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

* #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type. HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import [the Marked Library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

* #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

* #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

* #7: Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
